Networking basics #0
This project was the first of two introducing networking concepts. In this project, I answered a few quiz-like questions and wrote a couple bash scripts while learning about the OSI model, LAN and WAN networks, and TCP/UDP data transfer protocols.

Tasks:

What is the OSI model?

Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect
The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology
The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology
How is the OSI model organized?

Alphabetically
From the lowest to the highest level
Randomly

Questions:

What type of network a computer in local is connected to?

Internet
WAN
LAN
What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?

Internet
WAN
LAN
What network do you use when you browse www.google.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?

Internet
WAN
LAN

3. What is a MAC address?

The name of a network interface
The unique identifier of a network interface
A network interface
What is an IP address?

Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses
The unique identifier of a network interface
Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks

4. Write a Bash script that displays listening ports:

That only shows listening sockets
That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs

5.Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.

Requirements:

Accepts a string as an argument
Displays Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS} if no argument passed
Ping the IP 5 times
